/* 
 * The Dot Project
 * 
 * What I need to implement
 * 1. Animations: Idle, Run, Attack, Smoking
 * 2. Attack - 3 different spells; There I will use prototype pattern as in other project.
 * 3. Trading - you can buy hp, mana potion and at every other level more power armor.
 * 4. Enemies - 3/4 types??
 * 5. Checking if player is on ground.
 * 6. UI with hp/mana bars.
 * 
 * TODO: Start with 5, but also make new sprites for animation
